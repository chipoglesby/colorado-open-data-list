# colorado-open-data-list

A curated list of open data portals provided by local Colorado organizations (and some other public data that we're wrangling ourselves).

## State Organizations With Open Data

I frequently find myself browsing local data sources for pedagological / data science for social good projects. Sharing on the off-chance that it's useful to others! Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any additions.

Note: also consider checking data portals at different levels of government (e.g., City of Denver, Boulder County, and of course national sources like [data.gov](http://data.gov), [cdc.gov](http://cdc.gov/datastatistics/), and [censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org)).

## Citizen-Wrangled Data Sources

| [https://github.com/openelections](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-co)| Colorado Election Open Data | Pre-processed election results for Colorado elections| CSV |

There are many other sources of public data that may not meet the definition of "open data" (see the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) guidelines).

For example, I'm currently wrangling various data sets from from the Department of Public Health and Environment: e.g., permit violations from the Colorado Environmental Records archive ([colorado-environmental-records-scraper](https://github.com/chooliu/colorado-environmental-records-scraper)) and a list of sites associated with Clean Air Act Title V operating permits.

If you have a project wrangling Colorado data into machine-readable, open access format, feel free to submit a pull request alerting me to your project for inclusion here.

Alternatively, if you have a recommendation on what public data to wrangle next / want to work together on something, feel free to submit something in the Issues tab or get in touch.


## To-Do / Wishlist

* work on readability and formatting
* better curation / descriptions
* consider split into municipality, county, state, federal
